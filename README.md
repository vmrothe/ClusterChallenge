## Data to use
*matrix.txt* contains all data you need.

## Heatmaps
For comparison, you can see heatmaps for hierarchical, k-means, fuzzy c-means clustering and for the self-organizing maps method. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or other solutions. I am grateful for any kind of input. 

Thanks for trying and good luck! :four_leaf_clover:
